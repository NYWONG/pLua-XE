A fork of the pLua project, created by Jeremy Darling (@jdarling) and originally hosted at www.eonclash.com.

This modification has been updated for Delphi XE2 or higher. It still compiles and works with the older, non-Unicode Delphi releases.

pLua is a long term effort to build a set of methods (functions and procedures), objects, and types to aid Pascal Developers (FPC, Lazarus, and Delphi at the moment) in the implementation of Lua in their projects.
